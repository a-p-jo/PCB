# PCB-
Prime C Benchmark || Python v C Benchmark || Processor Computation Benchmark

3 Long Forms, One Acronym

PCB is a small project by a hobbyist dev.

PCB takes a 'Load Value'(L.V.) and a 'Repeat Count' as input.
PCB processes all natural numbers from 2 to (L.V. * 10^7) , times this,
and repeats for the number of times specified in 'Repeat Count'.
The number of primes found and the avergae time take over the runs is
then outputted. 

PCB does not purport to be an accurate benchmark for purpose of 
comparing performance across machines.It tests only for integer
division , supplies only CPU time, and compiler/OS optimizations
may vary

PCB is intended towards the following (under identical conditions) :

1) Measuring runtime performance changes across languages
2) Measuring of gains through overclocking/boosting CPU
3) Specifically measuring integer division capcity of CPU

And other uses as and when they arise that this rudimentary one-day
project can help serve. 

Any contribution/critique is welcome, but any updates/changes are
unlikely from the dev since this is not a real project, just a small
tool.
